        <h1 class="h1"><br>MY FAVORITE BOOKS</h1>
        <p class="pretext">Here is a list of my favorite books in alphabetical order.</p>

        <div class="fav">
            <h2 class="h2">Gone Girl</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="./images/1.jpg" alt="Gone Girl" height=10%; width=auto /></div>
            <p class="text">Author:<br>Genre:<br>Why I like it: I am normally not a fan of thriller and this book is one
                of the very few exceptions. I love how far a crazy wife would go to mess with her cheating husband. It
                reminds me of my own alternate personality. Her name is Mad Mia and she is still in development – but
                you can tell a lot by her name already ;)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fav">
            <h2 class="h2">Predictably Irrational</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="./images/2.jpg" alt="Predictably Irrational" height=10%; width=auto /></div>
            <p class="text">Author:<br>Genre:<br>Why I like it: As a Marketing student, this book was like a Bible to
                me. It points out interesting “flaws” in human decision-making process. Some can be aware of their flaws
                and try to fix them, while others (marketers!) learn how to exploit them. Either way, we will all learn
                something.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fav">
            <h2 class="h2">Sh*t My Dad Says</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="./images/3.jpg" alt="Sh*t My Dad Says" height=10%; width=auto /></div>
            <p class="text">Author:<br>Genre:<br>Why I like it: It is an entertaining book that contains vulgar
                language, which my ex-boyfriend did not like (and that is why he is now an ex). The author noted down
                his dad’s brutally honest opinion in daily life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fav">
            <h2 class="h2">The Flip Side</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="./images/4.jpg" alt="The Flip Side" height=10%; width=auto /></div>
            <p class="text">Author:<br>Genre:<br>Why I like it: This book is a collection of stories about how people
                came up with amazing ideas/ inventions during difficult times of their life. It gives me hope that my
                dumb brain will one day produce some sort of genius thoughts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fav">
            <h2 class="h2">The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared</h2>
            <div class="img"><img src="./images/5.jpg" alt="The Hundred-Year-Old Man" height=10%; width=auto /></div>
            <p class="text">Author:<br>Genre:<br>Why I like it: If it was not for the alphabetical order, this book
                would be on the first place of my list. I LOVEEEEE it and always want to read it again. The story itself
                is a fiction but it also incorporates real historical events into it.</p><br>
